// Package quiz runs multiple-choice quizzes (docs/courses/content-model.md, "Quiz"): an attempt draws its
// questions (shuffled unless the quiz says not to, `draw` of them for a final exam) with a deadline when the quiz
// has a time limit, and is scored on the server. Keys and explanations never leave it before the attempt is
// submitted; the attempt keeps the questions as drawn, so editing the quiz does not change a running attempt.
