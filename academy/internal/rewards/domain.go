// Package rewards awards XP and badges (docs/courses/content-model.md, "Rewards"). XP is not stored: it is the best
// pass of each lab plus the best attempt of each quiz, read from their modules. A badge is earned when its rule
// holds over the learner's history, or when a course that names it as its badge is completed; every rule is
// evaluated against the whole history, so a badge added later is awarded for what was done before (Phase 10's
// award_badges). Awards are kept even when the badge is retired.
